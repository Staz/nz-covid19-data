<p>Metrics on this page can use one of two views of the data. An operational view or a person view. There are two main differences between the views which result in slightly different totals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Occasionally doses that are recorded as first doses in CIR are actually a person's second doses. This means they will appear as dose 1 in the operational view but will appear as completed primary course in the person view (this is a data entry issue only and does not impact the dose that the person received).</li>
<li>Those who have been vaccinated overseas will only appear in the person view, they will not appear in the operational view.</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, the operational view shows how doses administered in New Zealand were recorded in CIR. The person view shows the vaccination status of people regardless of how that was recorded or whether it was in New Zealand.</p>
