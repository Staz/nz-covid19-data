<p>Metrics on this page can use one of two views of the data - An operational view or a person view.</p>
<p>The operational view shows all doses administered in New Zealand. The person view shows the vaccination status of people regardless of how that was recorded or whether it was in New Zealand. Those who have been vaccinated overseas will only appear in the person view, they will not appear in the operational view.</p>
<p>The person view includes all people that are currently alive and in the latest Health Service User (HSU) population. The current HSU in use is the financial year 2022/23 HSU (FY2022/23 HSU). The HSU is an estimate of the population using the health system in New Zealand. A person is included in the HSU if they use health services (including births and deaths) in the reference period, or are enrolled in a primary health organisation (PHO) during the reference period. The reference period for the FY2022/23 HSU is: 1/7/2022 to 30/6/2023.</p>
