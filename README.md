# nz-covid19-data

Some gotchas I found when playing with [Github flat data](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flat-data)

- The directories in the `downloaded_filename` path must already exist. They aren't created by the action. I was forced to create empty directories (apart from a README.md)

- Any paths in the postprocessing scripts must be relative to the repository root.

- Can't specify an alternative authorization header (something other than `Authorization:`) **and** use secrets.

### Other Scripts

`scripts/getmohpagesnapshots.sh` downloads the wayback machine archive for the [Ministry of Health COVID-19: Data and statistics webpages](https://www.health.govt.nz/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-data-and-statistics)

`scripts/processmohpagesnapshots.ts` renames each snaphot according to the date of the data contained within the page: `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm.html` (ISO 8601)
